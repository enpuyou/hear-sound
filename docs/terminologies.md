## F0/Fundamental Frequency Contour

[A Statistical Model of Speech F0 Contours](http://www.jonathanleroux.org/pdf/Kameoka2010SAPA09.pdf)

> The fundamental frequency (F0) contour in normal speech contains various types
> of information including emotional and other non-linguistic information such as
> the speakerâ€™s identity, mood and level of attention, and plays as important a
> role in our daily speech communication as formants, through which we encode a
> phonemic sequence to convey linguistic information to the listener(s). An F0
> contour is a realization of the vocal fold os- cillation with slowly varying
> frequencies, whose dynamics are governed by a combination of different factors,
> in particular the length and elasticity of vocal folds, laryngeal muscle
> tension, and subglottal air pressure. All possible F0 contours produced by a
> particular speech apparatus should thus be characterized and constrained by
> the presumably small number of parame- ters governing the control mechanism
> of vocal fold vibration. Therefore, how well the F0 contour of a certain sound
> matches the mechanical constraint is an important factor that determines how
> likely it is that the sound originates from a speech utter- ance. Accordingly,
> modeling the dynamics of the F0 contour of speech can be potentially very
> beneficial for any speech appli- cations that could be improved by taking
> account of the natural- ness in terms of the F0 contour.
